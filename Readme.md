RESULTS & PERFORMANCE
The bot beats Buy-and-Hold more than 6.8 times over from 2013 to 2015:

And you can see how it trades visually in this shorter test:

TRADING ALGORITHM
You can see from the backtests that it trades strong swing trends and also scalps dips whatever the trend. Trades are on the 1hr tick and the bot does not trade unless it detects what it thinks is a good opportunity.

EXCHANGES
Currently just BTC-e and Bitfinex but more incoming if demand is there.

SOURCE
The source is currently closed but may open up when I am happier with the formatting and cleared up a couple of the minor things to do. It is ready but I have a few ideas yet.

SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK
As it is free I am not available for constant support but I am happy to hear feedback and will be able to answer the odd question - just PM me.

TO DO
Improve the scalp buying aspect of the bot
Cut out some unwanted trades during sideways markets
Add more exchanges
Splitting orders for easier order throughput
Possibly some parameter options if it tests well
UPDATES
V2.5 - Parameter added for trend reaction speed
V2.0 - OPEN SOURCE
V1.4 - Better sell logic to compliment the scalping element. Bitfinex supported.
V1.3 - Log now shows fiat/btc balance once per day. When buying log now shows if it is a slow trend buy or a quick scalp buy.
V1.2 - Added slightly reworked trading logic plus cleaner graphing.
V1.1 - Minimum order fix. Stop orders below minimum from being attempted.
DISCLAIMER
As usual with all trading, only trade with what you are able to lose. This bot seems very solid to me but no-one can predict the market. I am not responsible for your losses if any occur.
